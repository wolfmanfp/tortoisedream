# Tortoise Dream

[Take control of a turtle,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtle_graphics) Logo style!

This was originally made in jQuery for a university course in 2016. I fixed some bugs and added more stuff... only three years later.

## Commands

- `go({distance})`
- `turn({degree})`
- `tailDown()`: the turtle lays down its tail to draw
- `tailUp()`: the turtle stops drawing
- `dream("{RGB}")`: the turtle draws with the given color
- `look()`: the turtle tells what color is underneath them
- `trip()`: our turtle tries "magic mushrooms" ;-)
